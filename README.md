üìã **Development Approach**

üîë **Key Decisions Made**

**Asynchronous Bid Handling with BullMQ**
To prevent race conditions and ensure atomicity, BullMQ queues bid creation jobs. This guarantees that simultaneous bids are processed sequentially in a controlled environment.

**Database Transactions for Consistency**
TypeORM transactions ensure all steps (item check, price comparison, saving bid, and updating highestBidId) are atomic. Failures rollback the transaction to maintain data integrity.

**Expiration Logic for Auctions**
Each item includes a duration. Bids are checked against the createdAt + duration timestamp to reject expired bids.



‚öôÔ∏è **Robustness & Scalability**

**Decoupled Processing**
Offloading bid logic to background workers ensures responsiveness and scalability under load.

**Horizontal Scalability**
Redis-based BullMQ supports distributed processing by spawning multiple workers.

**Graceful Error Handling**
Structured try-catch blocks and meaningful exceptions deliver clear API responses.

**No Race Conditions**
Combining queueing and transactions avoids concurrency issues, ensuring accurate bid placement.







‚úÖ **CI/CD Overview**
- CI (GitHub Actions): Automatically builds the Docker image on every push to the master branch.

- CD (Render): Automatically deploys the latest code from master using the Dockerfile.

- NOTE: env variaables are set in the render env variables
